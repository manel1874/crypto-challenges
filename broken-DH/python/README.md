# Python solution

First, let us check Bob's final step (4):


The naive approach in Python is to try the following:

```
proved = _g**_t == _a * _h**_c

print("Bob can check Alice's knowledge: ", proved)
```

However, due to the dimension of the numbers, we cannot do it in this way. We can, but probably that is the only this that we will 
be able to do during our lifetime...

We need a more efficient way to multiply and exponentiation big numbers.
